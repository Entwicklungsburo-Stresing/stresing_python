## @file: nonblocking_measurement.py
# @brief: This script shows how to operate the Stresing camera using the python module stresing.
# @details: This script initializes the camera, does one measurement, reads the data and plots the data. The data access happens after the complete measurement is done. This example is written for 1 camera on 1 PCIe board.
