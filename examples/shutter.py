## @file: camera.py
# @brief: This script shows how to operate the Stresing camera using the DLL interface.
# @details: This script initializes the camera, does one measurement, reads the data and plots the data. The data access happens after the complete measurement is done. This example is written for 1 camera on 1 PCIe board. This python example was created with DLL version 4.18.0
